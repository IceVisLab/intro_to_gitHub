### Key Definitions
- **Branches**: a unique set of code with a unique name, but still relevant to the repository you find it in. Every repository has at least one branch, and the default name for this is usually 'main' or 'master'
- **Clone**: making a copy of the code to your local computer to allow you to make edits using any software that you have
- **Fork**: making a copy of a whole project in a separate repository. You can suggest changes to the original copy, or you can take this new fork and go mysteriously in the wind to be a coding maverick

  To fork a repository, click the fork button in the top right corner (shown below)

- **GIT**: imagine a one-man local word document that has saved all edits you've made to a it so you can go back to check them out
- **GitHub**: an online GIT repository hosting service.
- **Merge**: allows independent lines of development (AKA branches) to be integrated into a single branch
- **Pull Request**: a request to tell others about changes to code you have made without changing the base code (yet) to allow for a team-review of the potential change.
- **Push Command**: a command which 'pushes' files from a local repository (e.g. your computer) to a remote repository (this intro_to_gitLab is a remote repository since it exists in the cloud and not in your computer).
- **Repository**: Think of it as a folder on a computer - a collection of files and different versions of a project (AKA Version Control System in fancy speak).
