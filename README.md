So, lets get to the GIT(â€¦hub)!

GitHub is a website which allows you to store code on a remote server called a repository, meaning it can be accessed from anywhere, not only locally from your computer. This code can be shared with other people and can be edited online without needing to be downloaded to your computer. Think of gitHub to coding what googleDocs is to Word - it allows multiple users to edit code online where it is clear to see who has done what and when.

Here, I will give a quick overview of the basics, and key definitions that keep on popping up.

When things are stored locally, this means files which are present on your computer, hard-drive etc. When things are stored remotely, it means they are stored in the cloud.

To upload a local file to this repository, click the **Add File** button above, and then **Upload Files**.
To create a remote file directly in gitHub, click click the **Add File** button above, and then **Create New File**.
To save a remote file to your computer, click the green **Code** button and click **Download ZIP**. 

If you have any questions (and there are no stupid questions, ask anything), click the 'Discussions' tab above and post it there - we can all clear up ponderings and become gitHub proficient in no time!
