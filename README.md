So, lets get to the GIT(â€¦hub)!

GitHub is a website which allows you to store code on a remote server called a repository, meaning it can be accessed from anywhere, not only locally from your computer. This code can be shared with other people and can be edited online without needing to be downloaded to your computer.

Here, I will give a quick overview of the basics, and key definitions that keep on popping up.

When things are stored locally, this means files which are present on your computer, hard-drive etc. When things are stored remotely, it means they are stored in the cloud.

So, think of gitHub to coding what googleDocs is to Word - it allows multiple users to edit code online where it is clear to see who has done what and when.

### Key Definitions
- Branches: a unique set of code with a unique name, but still relevant to the repository you find it in. Every repository has at least one branch, and the default name for this is 'master'
- Clone: making a copy of the code to your local computer to allow you to make edits using any software that you have
- Fork: making a copy of a whole project in a separate repository. You can suggest changes to the original copy, or you can take this new fork and go mysteriously in the wind to be a coding maverick
- GIT: imagine a one-man local word document that has saved all edits you've made to a it so you can go back to check them out
- GitHub: an online GIT repository hosting service.
- Merge: allows independent lines of development (AKA branches) to be integrated into a single branch
- Pull Request: a request to tell others about changes to code you have made without changing the base code (yet) to allow for a team-review of the potential change.
- Push Command: a command which 'pushes' files from a local repository (e.g. your computer) to a remote repository (this intro_to_gitLab is a remote repository since it exists in the cloud and not in your computer).
- Repository: Think of it as a folder on a computer - a collection of files and different versions of a project (AKA Version Control System in fancy speak).

If you have any questions (and there are no stupid questions, ask anything! somebody else might be wondering the same thing as you but feeling shy and then by asking you've helped yourself and them too :) ), click the 'Discussions' tab above and post it there and we can all clear up ponderings and become gitHub proficient in no time!
