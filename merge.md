### Making new Branches

Sometimes, it's useful to make a separate branch than your main one, if you want to test something out separately from the core code, rather than making many edits.

To make a separate branch, click the 'main' button above, type in the desired name of your new branch, 'merge' in the example before clicking 'Create branch: merge from 'main'.

This branch includes all the same files as the original, but is kept in a separate folder. The key difference between making a new branch and cloning is that a new branch is kept remotely in gitHub, whereas cloning involves saving the remote repository to a local source (i.e. from gitHub to your computer).
From this, you can have separate files and codes without changing anything in the original/main branch.

Creating a new branch can also be done when creating a new file. Before pressing commit, there is an option to commit to the branch you are working in, or by creating a new branch and starting a pull request.
