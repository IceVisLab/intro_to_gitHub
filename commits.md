Any changes to a file on GitHub is shown as a **commit**. To see the commits in this repository, click the 'code' tab above, and under the green code button, you will see something like this ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94135223/149165326-403fb730-d575-4280-a2b3-ec4fc22be991.jpg). Click it, and you will be brought to a page with the same number of rows as commits.

To see a previous edition and what was changed, click the blue hash. In the example below, this hash is '141a619'

From this, you can see any additions in green, anything removed in red. In this case, I deleted the empty top line and entered the key definitions.

And just below this, you can see the option to add a comment. You could do this as the person who made the commit, telling your team members what you did. Or, as a team member you can add a comment about this particular commit (i.e. version) of the code.
